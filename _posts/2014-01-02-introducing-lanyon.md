Hello World! This is my first post for my blog which will probably be updated rarely. I am really excited to be able to tell more about myself. This website is built using the Lanyon and Poole themes for Jekyll. Jekyll is a content management system for creating functional, simple, but elegant websites. 

Here is some info from the creator of Lanyon on his theme. I highly recomend you check it out. 

Thanks!
