Hello,<br>
I am Anant Sahai. I am currently in my senior year as a Computer Science major at the University of California, Berkeley. I am currently seeking full-time opportunities for when I graduate in May 2016. This website will serve as my homepage and will host an up to date copy of my resume as well as maintain links to various projects I am currently working on. Additionally, this site also contains a blog which I update periodically with my own thoughts and photography. I hope you enjoy your visit!<br>
